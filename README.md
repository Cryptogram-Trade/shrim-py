# Shrim.py, the Better Shrimpy API

This API connect to [Shrimpy Developers API](https://developers.shrimpy.io/) in a more flexible way than [the official API](https://github.com/shrimpy-dev/shrimpy-python).

It also covers a [Shrimpy Users API](https://www.shrimpy.io/docs/) that wasn't available until now.
